# Image to Text Data Map

This project converts an image into a text-based data map, where each pixel is represented by a character corresponding to its greyscale value. The result is a matrix of characters that visually and numerically represents the original image in text form.



## How It Works

1. **Upload an Image:**  
   paste your image into input folder < all format supported>
   rename it as < img >

3. **Processing:**  
   The image is resized (if needed), converted to greyscale, and each pixel's value is mapped to a character based on intensity.

4. **Output:**  
   The resulting matrix is displayed as text and can be downloaded.

## Usage
